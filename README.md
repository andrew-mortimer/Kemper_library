# Kemper_library

### What's this all about then?
Do you play guitar or bass?  (yes/no)
Do you own a Kemper profiling amplifier?  (yes/no)

if the answer to either of the above was "no" then follow this link... https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&type= 

### I'm still here... what's it about then?
At this stage, this is deeply daft, I'm just playing around with RShiny; I'm going to visualise the amplifier profiles I currently like at any given point in time.  I've got a few ideas for expansion though.

### Can I get involved?
Absolutely!  Always looking for new/additional dafties to collaborate with.  Fork with impunity, just make sure you rock out whilst doing it.

### What does this do?
Nothing yet, I've just started this but early versions might just start to appear on https://androo.shinyapps.io/Kemper_library/
